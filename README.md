# ssCalc
Inspired by the website Desmos, this project aims to outperform Desmos in some ways, and gain extended capability. This is mainly to fulfill my personal needs as I am unhappy with the limitations of Desmos. 

### Why not use MatLab?
Because it isn't as fun as making your own calculator.

## Usage
Compile command:
g++ -Wall main.cpp -lSDL2 -o ssCalc

Run command:
./ssCalc

## ToDos
- Make Equation Parser
- Make Classes for everything
- Add SDL_Event's (Let's keep this project relatively simple and mostly CL based)
